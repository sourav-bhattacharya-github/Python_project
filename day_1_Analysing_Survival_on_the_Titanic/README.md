## Objective

Explore and analyze Titanic passenger data to understand the patterns between personal attributes (age, gender, class, fare, etc.) and survival outcomes. Learn how to:

- Load, inspect, and clean real-world tabular data
- Use data visualization to uncover insights
- Transform and engineer useful features for further modeling

## Dataset Overview

Typically, the dataset includes:

- **PassengerId** ‚Äì Unique passenger identifier
- **Survived** ‚Äì Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass** ‚Äì Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**, **Sex**, **Age**, **SibSp**, **Parch**, **Ticket**, **Fare**, **Cabin**, **Embarked**

These fields allow analysis of demographics, fare class, family relations, and boarding location as factors in survival.
